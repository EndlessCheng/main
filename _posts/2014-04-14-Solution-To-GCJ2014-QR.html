<h2>Magic Trick</h2>
<p> Enumerate all possible card and check each card and obtain the possible card set POSSIBLE.<br/>
If |POSSIBLE| == 0, we say "Volunteer cheated!"<br/>
If |POSSIBLE| > 1, we say "Bad magician!"<br/>
If |POSSIBLE| == 1, we just output the unique card.<br/>

<h2>Cookie Clicker Alpha</h2>
<p>
Consider the final situation: there are U farms producing cookies.<br/>
What is the best strategy to buy U farms? <br/>
After buying the Uth farm, how many cookies we left?<br/>
Supposing we have some cookies left, why do not we buy the Uth farm in a earlier time?<br/>
If we buy it earlier, the situation is certain better.<br/>
So, the best strategy to buy U farms is "To buy each farm as early as possible, and the other<br/>
strategy is always worse than this one.<br/>
Using A[i] to record the best time to buy i farms, and A[i] can be easily calculate through A[i-1]<br/>
where A[0] = 0.<br/>
So we can enumerate each possible U and calculate the time to achieve the goal to find the best one.<br/>
When the time with i farms is longer than the best time to achieve the goal through no more than i-1 farms,<br/>
we stop enumerating.<br/>
What's the complexity of this algorithm?<br/>
We using S to denote the number that buying S+1 farms become worse than all the previous solutions.<br/>
We also using K to denote the number that buying S+1 farms become worse than the previous solutions.<br/>
It is easy to see K >= S.(It seems that K == S because of the monotonicity of solution)<br/>
We solve the inequality: TIME(K) &gt; TIME(K+1) and get:</br>
(X-C)/X &gt; (2 + K * F) / (2+(K+1)*F)</br>
The maximum of K which satisfy the above inequality is an upper bound of the algorithm.

<h2>Minesweeper Master</h2>
<p>
M == R*C - 1 is a special case, we solve it alone.<br/>
We can claim that, if it can be solved by a click, then:
<lu>
<li>There exist at least one ZERO cell (cell labelled 0).</li>
<li>All the ZERO cells are in the same connected component.</li>
<li>All the non-star cells are in a connected component.</li>
<li>Each cell with a label great label has a ZERO cell as its neighbour.</li>
</lu>
So the strategy is to enumerate the configuration which can satisfy the condition above <font color="red"><b>easily</b></font>.<br/>
The left-top corner is a u * v rectangle with star.<br/>
Then put the left stars in the left-bottom corner column by column, and from top to bottom in<br/>
each column.<br/>
We can see the above configurations can satisfy the first three condition and <br/>
most of them satisfy the last condition.</br>
After enumerating each configuration, check it.<br/>
Note: the configuration satisfy the condition easily does not mean all the configuration satisfy the condition.</br>

<h2>Deceitful War</h2>
<p>
The most important information in the description is "2.Naomi tells Ken the mass of the block she chose."<br/>
So, Ken's strategy is very simple:<br/>
<lu>
<li>If I have a heavier one, choose the lightest one I can get a point.</li>
<li>Otherwise, I choose the lightest on and get none point.</li>
</lu>
And Naomi's best strategy is to choose each from heavier to lighter.<br/><br/>
In Deceitful War, Naomi's strategy is to make each block as useful as possible.<br/>
If the lightest one is than the lightest of Ken's,<br/>
Naomi can say that it is very heavy, and Ken choose his lightest one, so Naomi get a point.<br/>
Otherwise, Naomi can say it is a little lighter than Ken's heaviest one, and make Ken's situation worse.<br/>
We can sort all the block and using to variable to indicate the lightest one and the heaviest one, and simulate<br/>
the game to get the answer.
