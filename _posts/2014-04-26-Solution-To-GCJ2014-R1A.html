<h2>Charging Chaos</h2>
<p>We can describe the problem in another way:<br/>
Given a 0-1 matrix A as the initial matrix and another 0-1 matrix B as the destination matrix.<br/>
We can flip some column of A such that the rows of A is a permutation of B.<br/>
The basic idea is that after some flips, the first row is equal to on row of B.<br/>
We enumerate the index of row of B, which is the first row of A equal to.<br/>
An O(n^2l) algorithm comes up.<br/>

<h2>Full Binary Tree</h2>
<p>
Given a tree, and removes some nodes to make it become a full binary tree.<br/>
The first step is to enumerate the root of the full binary tree, then apply tree-shaped dynamic programme.<br/>
We use cost[i] to denote the minimal cost of making the sub-tree with root i to become a full binary tree.<br/>
Then given a node i, its child count should become 0 or 2.<br/>
When a child j of i is selected to remove, then the cost is the nodes count of sub-tree j.<br/>
Otherwise, the cost is cost[j].<br/>
The minimal cost to select two children to remain can be solved by dynamic programme.<br/>
Total complexity: O(n^2).

<h2> Proper Shuffle</h2>
<p>
If it is random uniformly shuffled, the probability of number I existing on position J is 1/N.<br/>
Otherwise we can pre-calculate the probability of number I existing on position J.<br/>
The sub-problem can be solved in a dynamic programme algorithm in O(n^3) and it is possible to be optimized to O(n^2).<br/>
But, a much easier way is to simulate the non-uniform shuffle algorithm one million times and obtain the probability.<br/>
We use p[I][J] to denote the probability of number I exists on position J.<br/>
The strategy is to compare p[input[0]][0] * p[input[1]][1] * ... * p[input[N-1]][N-1] to (1/N)^N.<br/>
The value may be too small, so we apply log function on each value.<br/>
When the first value is smaller, the probability of the uniform-random algorithm is bigger, and vice versa.<br/>

There are some other strategies based on other characteristic of the random shuffle algorithm.<br/>
